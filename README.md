# Pixels...and-code.
Whoever says that Python is not a good software for creative, artistic coding can f---



Anyways, this is my code for Computational Cameras Week 5.

Basically, this is my first time using Processing for things other than creating smiley faces.

The gist of the three codes I used are:
1) Get the pictures to have a sort of Sin City vibe.
2) Extract pixels whose RGB values are in the middle. For example, if the R is in the middle, change its R to a G.
3) Just make the picture black and white...with added opacity fixing.

Nothing really special....except the fact that I did not write in Java :l
